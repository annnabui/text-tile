            My thesis explores the intersection of craft and technology, challenging the notion that traditional expressions of decoration are outdated or incompatible with the modern age. As I observe my own generation's diminished appreciation for craftsmanship—a shift driven by capitalism, industrialization, and the rise of STEM bias—I argue that technology doesn't have to eliminate traditional forms of decoration but can enrich them. Drawing inspiration from postmodernist thinkers like Casey Reas and Ben Fry, I examine how coding can enhance ancient creative practices.<br><br>
            The thesis unfolds through three main experiments: Vietnamese encaustic tiles, New York City subway tiles, and fiber arts—specifically knitting. Each study investigates the tensions between tradition and modernity, colonized and colonizer, and uniformity versus individuality. The final experiment articulates the craft-to-tech translation by bringing digital techniques like anti-aliasing into knitting. As I explore the history of each craft, I also uncover the overlooked stories of marginalized communities who contributed to these traditions.
